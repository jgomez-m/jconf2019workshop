      Reactive is a next logical step from functional programming

      functional programming is using functional composition and
        lazy evaluation

      Reactive programming also uses functional composition and
        lazy evaluation, and builds on top of those ideas

      We take the functional programming ideas and work on
      different channels for communication along with a better/different
      way to deal with error handling.

      exceptions are imperative style of programming idea

      Functional is mutually exclusive with exceptions

      Reactive deals with exceptions down stream, built as a programming
      model


      It separate dealing with data from handling error nicely.

      It is based on the idea of circuit breaker
